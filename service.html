				<div class="hello">Web Hosting
					<p class="about">Web hosting is a requisite for business owners and digital creators; it's not something you can afford to skimp on in this digital age. People turn to the internet when searching for services, products, and content, so your business must have a reliable and easily accessible website for potential clients to find. Even a basic webpage that simply lists your business’ hours of operation and contact information can give your venture the air of legitimacy it needs in this cyber-connected world.

						In truth, long gone are the days when businesses were listed in yellow pages. Nowadays, your business is practically invisible if it can't be found in a search engine. You need a sharable website to build an online presence, because without one your business lacks discoverability, which greatly hinders your earning potential. Granted, web hosting isn’t exclusively a business investment; if you’re aiming to host a personal site, blog, or project, hosting services are also highly valuable. Regardless of your website target, the services listed here should cover your bases.
						
						The first step in building your online presence is finding a web host, the company that stores your website's files on its servers and delivers them to your readers' and customers' browsers. Bluehost, for example, is a PCMag Business Choice winner and a reader-recommended option. That said, the other services highlighted below are worth your time, too.
