							<h3>Basic Designing Tools</h3>  
The first web designer skill that you must acquire is an understanding of basic designing tools. These tools are the primary platforms using which you can craft a promising website. However, you will need to make sure that you use the right tools at the right time. For instance, Photoshop is a good instrument for image processing, but when it comes to graphic design, Adobe Illustrator will prove to be more helpful. Getting familiar with such intricacies will acquaint you with the entire designing canvas. 

<h3> UX/UI And Visual Design</h3> 
According to recent research, 75% of people form an opinion about a website, based completely on its look and feel. This means that to become a web designer, you will have to master the craft of enhancing the UX (user experience) & UI (User interface). Begin by designing a website that is visually appealing. Use tools like grid systems, colour psychology, type hierarchy, and web fonts. Ensure that the website is responsive to all kinds of devices. Learning these will instantly give a forward push to your web design career.
<h3> HTML & CSS</h3>
Gaining thorough knowledge about HTML (Hypertext markup language) and CSS (Cascading style sheets) is one of the finest web designer skills that you can aim to learn. Both HTML and CSS are the fundamental blocks upon which the style and structure of a website are built. They enable you to read and edit a page, as often as you want to. By learning these principal languages, you will easily be able to secure a decent web design job. 

<h3>Programming Languages </h3>
Apart from HTML and CSS, if you can learn a couple of other programming languages, your web design career prospects will definitely improve. It will be great if you can master JavaScript, Python, Swift and C++ but if you have to choose amongst any one of these, go for JavaScript. This is because, as per a Stack-Overflow survey, more than 65% of designers already prefer to work with Java. Knowing these languages will immediately make you stand a class apart. 

<h3>Web Server Management</h3>
A highly overlooked web designer skill, which most designers are not very proficient with is – web server management. Although web servers are not technically within the domain of web designing, understanding their basic functioning will help you prevent downtime while solving problems in a quick and smart way.
